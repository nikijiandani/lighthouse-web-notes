### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript

function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  //Check if I'm hungry or not
  if(hungry !== true){
    console.log("Wait for now and come back when you're hungry!");
  } else {
    if(availableTime < 20){
      console.log("Pick something up and eat in back in the Lab or in the kitchen");
    } else if (availableTime >= 20 && availableTime <= 30){
      console.log("You deserve a break! Try a place in Gastown");
    } else {
      console.log("this is a bootcamp after all and you should probably reconsider.")
    }
  }
}

```
